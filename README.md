# The Weird Contracts

Welcome to the Weird Contracts, where I create weird Solidity contracts, these contracts are not production tested, so make sure know what you are doing and don't blindly copy and deploy (unless for testing purposes)


## License 
This project is licensed under the MIT license. Which means anyone can use or modify the code however they want.

## Installation
I just use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to compile and deploy the code, because each file is a full contract on it's own, but if anything changes in the future, I will be sure to update this README file.

## Contrubution 
This is a side project I created just for fun, so there might be some issues, please if you find any, fork this project and submit a pull request. If you also have a weird contract idea you want to add, great! go for it, I have added a button to make it easy to fork the repository remotely.
